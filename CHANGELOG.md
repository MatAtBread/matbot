# Changelog

All notable functional changes are documented here. Purely stylistic or
non-functional changes (CSS, refactoring, code tidying, docs-only merges) are
omitted.

Within each section, changes are grouped: **Breaking changes**, **API gaps
filled**, and **Bug fixes** cover `core` (the contract consumers depend on);
**Optional** covers new or updated plugins, frontends, and apps — more likely to
churn and less likely to affect a consumer who doesn't use them.

## Unreleased

### API gaps filled

- **`followup` hooks can now `retractAndRerun` a committed turn.** A new
  `FollowupResult.retractAndRerun?: { context }` capability alongside the existing
  `resubmit`: instead of appending a robo turn *after* the response, the pump pops the
  just-committed turn back to (and excluding) the last user message into a durable
  retraction marker (creator `matbot-retraction`; `data.retracted` holds the popped
  messages and `data.injected` the ephemeral context fed to the redo — the pair fully
  traces the swap for a strike-through render and post-mortem, LLM-elided like any marker),
  then re-runs that same user turn with `context` injected ephemerally. Filled by:
  `runFollowup` collecting a merged `retract`; a `redo?: { ephemeral }` field on the
  pump's queue item that skips the persist-at-turn-start user append and forwards the
  context to `runSession` via a new `RunSessionOpts.injectedEphemeral` (merged ahead of
  `screen`'s ephemeral, sharing the identical tail-fold path). `resubmitDepth` caps a
  non-self-terminating chain. Also fixed: ephemeral now tail-folds onto the last
  *non-marker* message, so a trailing marker (e.g. the retraction marker) doesn't
  swallow the injected context.

### Optional

- **triggers** (`@matatbread/matbot-triggers`, cross-runtime) — a data-driven
  hooks subsystem. A `Trigger` is a stored
  `{ conditions: { kind: 'augment'|'retract'|'followup'; rule }[]; invoke: { tool; params? } }`
  document; when an LLM classifier judges any condition matched against the current turn,
  the named tool is invoked. A condition's `kind` is a single discriminator fixing the
  surface judged, the hook, and how the tool's *output* reaches the model:
  `augment` (judge the user message in `screen`; inject the output ephemerally into the
  turn about to run), `retract` (judge the assistant response in `followup`; the response
  is *wrong*, so discard it and re-run the user turn with the output injected —
  `retractAndRerun`), `followup` (judge the assistant response; it *stands* but needs a
  steer, so keep it and resubmit the output as a robo turn — e.g. Inner Voice / Verify
  Assumptions, which need the response in context). A tool that yields no result runs as a
  silent side-effect. Injected payloads are fenced as system-supplied context (so the
  model doesn't read them as the user speaking), and an `augment` injection (otherwise
  never persisted) leaves a diagnostic `triggers` marker (`data.event:
  'ephemeral-inject'`) recording what was fed in, for post-mortem tracing. Two re-fire
  guards keep an agent-phase retract from amplifying: a retract *redo* re-runs the same
  user turn, so user-phase (augment) triggers are **held off** on a redo (else their side
  effects — e.g. `remember_fact`'s store write — double-apply), and a retract rule that was
  *active* on the previous turn (fired **or** itself held off) and is still matching is held
  off as non-converging — so it stays suppressed turn after turn while it keeps matching
  (each suppression re-arms the guard) rather than oscillating fire/suppress, and un-sticks
  only when the rule genuinely stops matching (a well-behaved rule self-terminates and never
  hits this). Both hold-offs are recorded with a `data.event: 'suppressed'` marker (a machine
  `cause` + human `reason`) — suppression is never silent, so a later "why didn't it fire?"
  is answerable from the session. The surface a condition is judged on (user message vs
  assistant response) is *derived* from `kind` (`surfaceOfKind`), not a stored field. This
  generalises skill-firing — "fire skill X" is just `invoke: skill_action({ action: 'use' })`,
  no longer special-cased (`use` applies the skill as a directive; `load` returns raw content
  and is not for firing). Exposes a `Triggers` service (CRUD + `importIfAbsent`, idempotent
  by invocation) and a `trigger_action` tool (`list`/`query`/`get`/`add`/`update`/`remove`;
  `query` filters by invoke target). An absent target tool degrades soft (does nothing
  until present). (See `docs/TRIGGERS-RATIONALE.md` for the *why*.)

- **skills** — a skill can be flagged a **system skill** (`SkillDoc.catalogue: boolean`): when set,
  it's advertised in the always-on system-prompt catalogue, using its generated `knowledge.summary`
  (or the optional hand-written `catalogSummary` override, when present). `skill_action(save)` takes
  an optional `catalogue` boolean (omit to leave unchanged) and `metadata` returns the current flag;
  the always-on contributor now advertises only `catalogue === true` skills (skipping any without a
  summary yet). The web skill editor's metadata pane gains a "This is a system skill" checkbox,
  persisted on save (the summary itself isn't hand-editable yet — the generated one fills the blank).
  This is how the former `system`-phase trigger's catalogue role lives on, as data rather than a trigger.

- **skills** — trigger ownership moved out to `@matatbread/matbot-triggers`. Removed the
  `skill_triggers` tool, the embedded `SkillDoc.triggers` array, and the two
  trigger-evaluation hooks. The former `system`-phase trigger (the system-prompt skills
  catalogue) is now a `SkillDoc.catalogSummary` field. Skills are content + catalogue
  only; firing on a condition is a trigger whose `invoke` is `skill_action(use)`.
  Breaking for skills-*package* consumers: dropped exports `SkillTrigger`,
  `TriggerPhase`, `createSkillTriggersTool`. (Existing installs: embedded `triggers`
  arrays in stored skill docs go dormant; a one-off offline migration moves them into
  the triggers store and `catalogSummary`.)

- **cognition** — seeds its built-in skills' triggers into the `Triggers` service (one
  use-trigger per skill, conditions grouped) instead of embedding them, discovering
  `Triggers` off the registry the same way it discovers `SkillManager`.

- **cognition** — the "Remember this" skill is **retired**: it was compiled by hand into the
  `remember_fact` tool, so the prose `SkillDoc` is gone and its conditions now live as data
  (`REMEMBER_CONDITIONS`) firing the tool. `remember_fact` now captures from **whichever message
  fired it** — the latest non-robo user *or assistant* message (an `augment` condition fires
  pre-response so the tail is the user message; a `followup` condition fires post-commit so the
  tail is the assistant response, e.g. promising to remember / owning a mistake) — fixing the
  prior bug where an agent-phase fire read the user message instead. De-duplication is deliberately
  not done (a repeated fact is an importance signal; consolidation is dream-time's concern).

- **frontend/web** — skill editor's Triggers tab rewired to the triggers store: it finds
  the skill's use-trigger via `trigger_action query` and edits that trigger's conditions
  (a wholesale replace on save). Each condition is a `kind` (`augment`/`retract`/`followup`)
  + rule, defaulting new rows to `augment` (the user-message routing case).

- **frontend/web** — a `matbot-retraction` marker now drops the superseded assistant
  response from the live thread (matching the post-refresh state, where it's popped from
  the session) and renders as a collapsed, thinking-styled "Retraction" block holding
  only the final text of the retracted turn (no thinking/tool blocks). Assistant response
  wraps are tagged with their `traceId` so the live removal can target the right one.

- **providers/openai-compat** — assistant messages with tool calls but no text are now sent
  with `content` **omitted** rather than `content: null` (the spec makes `content` optional
  once `tool_calls` is present, and stricter validators — e.g. gpt-5.x — reject
  `"content": null` with "expected a string, got null"). A tool result whose tool yielded no
  value (e.g. `remember_fact`, which yields only a marker) now serializes as `"null"` rather
  than `JSON.stringify(undefined)` → `undefined`. Both surface when the model invokes a
  no-result tool (a bare tool-call turn plus an empty tool result).

- **providers/anthropic** — a tool result whose tool yielded no value now serializes as
  `"null"` rather than `undefined` (a `tool_result` block must carry content). The assistant
  null-content case does not arise here (tool calls are `tool_use` content blocks, and an
  empty-content message is dropped).

## Previously

### Breaking changes

- **`StoreQuery` redesigned as a minimal, backend-translatable grammar.** The
  previous query type was an unfinished superset (filter/fullText/vector/sort-with-magic-fields/
  offset/projection/explain) that every backend "implemented" by loading all rows
  and filtering in JS. It is replaced by a small closed grammar where every
  construct maps natively to SQL/Elasticsearch/Mongo/IndexedDB. Consumer-visible
  consequences:
  - `Filter` is now a closed union discriminated by `op`
    (`eq`/`neq`, `lt`/`lte`/`gt`/`gte`, `in`/`nin`, `exists`, `stringContains`,
    `arrayContains`, `and`/`or`/`not`).
  - `FieldPath = string | string[]` — a bare string is **one** key (no longer split
    on `.`); use an array for nested paths.
  - `StoreQuery` is no longer generic; `QueryResult<T>` now has flat `items: T[]`
    plus optional `cursor`/`total`. All callers (background, sessions, skills,
    frontend/dom, persist-ki-bge, tool-store) migrated to the flat shape.
  - Comparisons are type-strict (`5 ≠ "5"`); `null` and absent collapse to a single
    "missing" state observable only via `exists`.
  - Invalid queries throw a located `StoreQueryError` (JSON pointer + code) at the
    boundary instead of silently mis-matching.
  - Full-text/vector search, field-vs-field comparison, and regex are intentionally
    removed from `Store` (they live on `KnowledgeIndex`/future interfaces).

### API gaps filled

- **The `Vault` backend is now swappable at runtime via `services.register('Vault', impl)`.**
  Storage and knowledge were already replaceable behind a capture-safe forwarding
  proxy, but the vault was the one core backend a plugin could not replace. Filled
  by wrapping the active vault in the same `forwardingProxy` over a mutable
  `activeVault`, adding a `register('Vault', …)` branch that re-points it, and
  exposing a `Vault?` swap-handle key on `MatbotServices` (the read path stays
  `services.vault`). References captured before a swap keep resolving to the live
  impl. This enables, e.g., an encrypted per-user DB-backed secret store in place of
  `.env`.
- **`MemoryStore` (apps/cli) now honours queries.** It previously ignored them; it
  now delegates to the shared `executeQuery` reference engine like the other
  in-memory backends.
- **`singleTurn` promoted to a first-class `MatbotServices` method** (alongside
  `complete()`), implemented in both hosts (cli, web-bundle) as a thin delegation to
  their own `complete()`. The pure, platform-independent helpers (`forwardingProxy`,
  `makeSwappable`, `SwapFn`, `singleTurnRequest`) moved into plugin-api; the skills
  plugin now calls `services.singleTurn(...)`.
- **`services.isSubAgent`** added to the plugin-api.
- **Initiating provider passed through to tools** (e.g. `background`) via a new field
  on the tool-execution context.
- **Tool listing now returns tool names & descriptions** (core `tool-plugin`, plus
  the browser plugin-tool).
- **Hook self-removal: every hook `ctx` now carries `removeHook()`**, which
  unregisters the currently-running hook — the clean one-shot primitive (no plugin
  name, no `removeByPlugin`).
- **Hook-failure visibility:** a throwing hook is recorded (deduped by identity) and
  drained into a `matbot-hooks` marker by the next `runScreen`; a new `marker`
  `PipelineEvent` carries it live. The `SkillManager` service key was added to the
  `MatbotServices` augmentation.

### Bug fixes

- **`plugin reload` now actually re-evaluates plugin code from disk.** Two stacked
  regressions: (1) the cache-bust stamp (`?mbfresh`) was silently bypassed because
  the node host always pre-populated `importSpec` with an absolute `file://` URL, so
  Node re-served the cached module — fixed with `freshImportSpec()`, which stamps a
  pre-resolved `file:` URL while leaving `blob:`/other schemes untouched; (2) tool
  executors were resolved from a turn-start registry snapshot, so a reload performed
  mid-turn didn't affect later tool calls in that same turn — fixed by resolving the
  executor against a live `toolRegistry` at call time (the snapshot remains the
  stable tool list advertised to the model, preserving prompt caching). A tool
  removed mid-turn now correctly resolves to "Unknown tool".
- **`StoreQuery` paging no longer overlaps.** Cursors are now opaque, stateless and
  self-contained (carrying `{where, sort, limit, offset}`), and sort always appends
  `id` as a final tiebreaker. Previously the cursor held only an offset, so page 2
  sent without a sort fell back to id-order and overlapped page 1.
- **Throwing hooks are isolated, not fatal.** The dispatcher now catches a handler
  that throws, logs it, and treats it as a no-op on every channel — fixing a hard
  failure where a `screen` hook calling a misconfigured provider (unresolved secret)
  threw at the top of every turn, killing the loop with no in-chat recovery.
  Intentional stops remain return values (`abort`/`rejectTool`), never throws.

### Optional

- **frontend/web** — queued-message UI no longer folds a quickly-queued message into
  the wrong bubble: only a head still waiting behind a running turn (`queued > 0`)
  opens a foldable batch; a head that runs immediately (`queued === 0`) is sealed
  synchronously by `pump`, fixing the live/reload rendering mismatch.
- **cognition** (new plugin) — `@matatbread/matbot-cognition`, a consumer of the
  skills service that seeds built-in skills (Inner voice, Remember this, Dream-time)
  create-if-absent, discovering the live `SkillManager` off the registry and
  degrading gracefully (deferred one-shot screen hook) when none is present yet.
- **tool-store** (new plugin) added.
- **skills** — now registers the `SkillManager` service (idempotent / double-setup
  safe); trigger classifier reworked so the opposing prior turn is a first-class
  input (relational triggers can use it); agent-phase robo resubmit names matched
  skills instead of inlining full content, so history no longer accumulates whole
  playbooks on every fire.
- **frontend/web** & **CLI** — render the new `matbot-hooks` marker live and on
  reload (amber warning pill / amber ⚠ line).
- **telegram** — no longer polls in the background.
- Plugin bug fixes: **background** correctly sets `allowed` on writes with a clearer
  HTTP error on disallowed; **frontend/web** send/stop button state on session switch
  + initial-message echo; mangled robo message; tool-store type-extraction regex;
  absolute path leak in workspace list.
