### Patch Changes

- 8411e61: Storage consumers no longer keep an in-memory snapshot of their store. `TriggerManager` and `SkillManager`
  each used to hold a `Map` loaded once at boot and serve reads from it — which made their read semantics a
  property of the backend impl: the snapshot was **principal-blind** (a storage profile isolating `triggers`/
  `skills` still saw the base partition's data, because the cache was loaded under the boot principal) and
  **stale under any second writer** (a shared DB, another process). It was only accidentally correct while the
  backend was a private single-writer filesystem.

  Both now read straight through the store proxy, which follows both the live backend and the current
  principal's partition: `Triggers.all/get/query` and `SkillManager.all/list/get` return `Promise`s. Skills
  keep everything that was _not_ a read cache — the KnowledgeIndex projection (`load` re-indexes on boot and on
  a storage swap but holds no copy), the detached analysis, and the `watch()` event stream. The skills
  system-prompt catalogue contributor is now async (`SystemContextContributor` already permits that).

  Caching, where a slow backend needs it, belongs in the StorageBackend, not the consumer — a forthcoming
  `CachingStorageBackend` decorator (write-through, optional change-feed else TTL). `skills-node` carries a
  large comment marking its `node:fs` watch of the skill directory as the filesystem twin of this same
  anti-pattern: a deliberately-kept example of what not to reach for.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Typed, self-repairing codegen pipeline: ToolProxy trailing catch-all overload (sound `ReturnType`, better bad-call errors, dynamic union dispatch); one worker-hosted checker in tool-types with annotated diagnostics and a structural cast gate (no main-thread block, no fallback); skills_compiler embeds the tool-contract dts in every prompt, threads the interactive prompt channel into demonstrations, distils honestly, verifies installs, and repairs over 4 passes; function-tools enforces lambda's one-argument convention.
