## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- 3e662d0: Mid-turn steering: a submission arriving while a turn runs can now **interrupt** it.

  - **API gaps filled.** `SubmitOpenOpts` gains `mode: 'queue' | 'interrupt' | 'auto'` (default `queue`,
    backward-compatible). `interrupt` stops the running turn — keeping its committed partial work (the
    agentic loop already commits coherently on abort, so no dangling tool-call) — and runs the new
    message next with a "keep going, noting the above" nudge, rather than waiting for the turn boundary.
    The decision is made inside the runner, synchronously against the running state, so an interrupt can
    never land on a later turn.
  - **New optional service `SteeringPolicy`** (`MatbotServices`): under `mode: 'auto'`, its `classify`
    (regex / semantic / LLM — not assumed to be an LLM) decides queue vs interrupt; its `nudge` supplies
    the continuation nudge. Both members optional; absent ⇒ host defaults (`DEFAULT_STEERING_POLICY`,
    `interrupt`, and a built-in nudge).
  - **New `PipelineEvent` variant `steer`** — announces an interrupt so a frontend places the new bubble
    and reads the imminent `aborted` (reason `'steer'`) as a yield, not a dead-end.
  - **Interrupted tool results are reframed.** A tool that errors while the turn is aborted (a steer, a
    cancel) no longer leaks the raw abort reason (`"Error: steer"`) into its result — the runner records a
    neutral "interrupted before completion" message, so a steer's continuation turn reads a clear signal
    and doesn't reflexively re-run a side-effecting tool.
  - **Optional (frontend/web).** `POST /sessions/:id/submit` accepts `mode`, defaulting to `auto` — the
    web frontend opts into steering (interrupt-by-default with no policy registered). Other frontends are
    unchanged (runner default `queue`). The web UI renders the `steer` event as its user bubble live, and
    no longer re-renders the session from the interrupted turn's `aborted` snapshot (which lacked the
    not-yet-persisted steer message and wiped the live bubble until a manual refresh).

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- 53bf4f8: Partitioned live events now cover skills as well as files, and a profile created mid-session is watched
  without a restart.

  - **Skills fan-out.** `SkillManager.watch()` now yields origin-stamped events (`Routed<SkillEvent>`, the
    acting principal), and the web firehose filters `skill-changed` per connection just like files. A profile
    that isolates the `skills` namespace sees only its own skill CRUD; profiles that don't still see the
    shared/base skills. (The `SkillManager`'s in-memory catalogue is still principal-blind — a separate,
    deeper fix — but the event stream is now partition-correct.)
  - **One generic visibility predicate.** `WatchVisibility` gains `visible(viewer, namespace, origin)` (was a
    file-specific `visibleTo`), defined as `route(viewer, ns) === route(origin, ns)`: routing _both_ sides
    makes it correct whether the origin is a partition (files) or the acting principal (skills), and yields
    "global events for namespaces you haven't isolated, own-partition only for those you have".
  - **Dynamic partitions — no restart.** The profiles backend now feeds one long-lived, origin-stamped file
    broadcaster from a watch pump per partition, and starts a pump the moment a profile is created — so a
    profile made after the frontend connected receives its file events live. (Previously the partition set was
    snapshotted when the watch began, needing a restart to pick up a new profile.)
  - **`profile` tool renamed to `profile_action`** for consistency with the other `*_action` tools.

- 36fee95: The web frontend now honours an `x-matbot-principal` request header as a generic per-request identity
  override, taking precedence over any registered `WebPrincipalResolver` (`headerPrincipal(req) ?? resolver
?? default`). This lets a browser act as a chosen identity even when a resolver (e.g. web-principal-user
  or auth) pins a default. The `headerPrincipal` helper is exported. The shared UI also shows a profile
  selector (left of the title) when a `profile` tool is registered, sending the selected profile as that
  header; it stays hidden otherwise, so default deployments are unchanged. Each profile row gains a gear that
  edits which namespaces the profile isolates — a checklist populated from the tool's `available_namespaces`
  action, applied via `set_isolated` — and the new-profile row gains a matching (collapsed) chooser so a
  profile's isolated set can be picked at creation.

  The URL fragment now accepts an optional leading profile: `#<profile>:<session>~<params>`, every part
  optional so existing `#<session>` / `#<session>~<params>` links are untouched. At load — before any
  session loads — a `#<profile>:…` prefix (or a lone `#<profile>` that names an existing profile) adopts
  that profile, then strips itself from the hash. Each profile row in the selector gains a link icon that
  copies its shareable `#<profile>` URL to the clipboard.

- a3cfbfa: Serve profile-partitioned files by URL. A browser GET (an `<img>`, a download link) can't send the
  `x-matbot-principal` header, so `url_for_resource` now bakes the current principal into the path as a
  leading `~<principal>` segment when profile-aware storage is active, and the `GET /files` route parses it
  back out and reads under that principal. `~` is excluded from principal ids and namespaces, so the
  segment is unambiguous; without profiles the URL is byte-identical to before.

  Also fixes a deep-link bug: the `hashchange` handler didn't strip a `#<profile>:` prefix the way the
  load-time parser does, so navigating to a profile deep-link mid-session treated `profile:session` as a
  session id. It now splits the profile off — switching (reload) when it differs from the active one,
  stripping it in place when it matches — before parsing the session fragment.

- c3a1b00: The chat header gains a share button (shown only when a `profile` tool is registered and a session is
  open). Clicking it pops a small menu of target profiles — those that isolate `sessions`, minus the
  active one — and each pick POSTs `share` (`{ namespace: 'sessions', id: <session>, target }`) for the
  open conversation, reporting success or the backend's error inline. A session shared IN from another
  profile (resolved via the `owner` action on open) hides the share button — you can't re-share what you
  don't own — and shows a "read-only · &lt;owner&gt;" badge. It all stays hidden in default deployments, so
  nothing changes when profile-aware storage isn't active.

### Patch Changes

- 5c244c1: fix(frontend-web): click-to-install banners name the exact package and discover locally first

  The "Enable workspace", "Install edit-session", and "Enable sessions" banners sent the
  LLM a partial plugin name, which led it to guess registry name variations. They now name
  the exact package (`@matatbread/matbot-tool-workspace`, `@matatbread/matbot-edit-session`,
  `@matatbread/matbot-sessions`), instruct it to run `discover_local` first and add from the
  local cache if present, and only then fall back to npm/github by that exact name — with an
  explicit "do not guess other name variations".

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- b40c2ec: fix: correct misplaced workspace dependencies

  Several plugins declared type-only `@matatbread/*` imports (the runtime coupling
  is via the service registry, not the import) under `dependencies`, which made a
  packed/published tarball try to install them from the registry:

  - frontend-web: `matbot-skills` → devDependencies
  - cognition: `matbot-skills`, `matbot-triggers` → devDependencies
  - web-principal-user: `matbot-frontend-web` → devDependencies
  - docker-bash: removed `matbot-tool-bash` (entirely unused; the "replaces bash"
    relationship is runtime via the registry, never imported)

- 589e061: Ship the static UI assets (index.html, app.js, browser.js, http-transport.js,
  favicon) by listing them concretely in `files`. Previously `files` was `["src"]`, so
  the published package omitted the web UI it serves at runtime; concrete entries also
  let a github/http install mirror them (a raw host can't be directory-listed).
